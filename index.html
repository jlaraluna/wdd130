        <p>Hello, world! My name is Joel, and I am currently learning HTML as part of my journey into web development. I
            have a great passion for music, and in my free time, I enjoy exploring different genres and playing
            instruments. I am excited to learn more about coding and how to build websites from scratch!</p>

        <p>Mexico is a country rich in history, culture, and natural beauty. It is known for its ancient civilizations,
            colonial cities, and vibrant traditions. The image showcases the Temple of Kukulcán, also known as El
            Castillo, a stunning step-pyramid located in Chichén Itzá, Yucatán. This architectural marvel was built by
            the Maya civilization and serves as an astronomical and ceremonial center, reflecting their advanced
            knowledge of mathematics and astronomy.</p>
